In this project i created a timer based on the pomodoro technique that helps to focus on activities.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have. Using this method, you divide your workday into 25-minute chunks, separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are called pomodoros.

See how it's used: www.youtube.com.br
